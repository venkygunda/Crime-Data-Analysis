# Crime-Data-Analysis

Crime Data Analysis Project

This project is focused on analyzing crime data for the city of London using Python and its data analysis libraries like NumPy and Pandas. The aim of the project is to provide insights into the nature of crimes committed in London and help identify patterns and trends that can inform law enforcement agencies and policy makers.

Data Set
The data set used in this project is the London crime data set, which is publicly available on the London Datastore. The data set contains information about the number of crimes reported in each borough of London, broken down by crime category and month.

Methodology
The project uses Python and its data analysis libraries to process, clean, and visualize the crime data. The analysis begins by importing the data into a Pandas DataFrame, which is then cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing or invalid data.

Once the data is cleaned, various statistical analyses and visualizations are performed to gain insights into the crime data. This includes analyzing crime trends over time, identifying the most common types of crimes in London, and identifying hotspots where crime is most prevalent.

Results
The analysis provides several insights into the nature of crime in London. Some of the key findings include:

Overall, crime in London has been decreasing over time, with a few exceptions.
Theft and handling of stolen goods is the most common type of crime in London.
Westminster, Camden, and Southwark are the boroughs with the highest crime rates.
Crime is most prevalent in the evening and early morning hours.
These insights can help law enforcement agencies and policy makers make informed decisions about how to allocate resources to prevent and combat crime in London.

Files
The following files are included in this project:

crime_data_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code used for the analysis.
london_crime_data.csv: The original crime data set downloaded from the London Datastore.
README.md: This file.
Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
These libraries can be installed using pip or any other Python package manager.

Usage
To run the analysis, simply open the crime_data_analysis.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment and run the code. The analysis will generate various visualizations and output statistics to help you understand the crime data.
